Original Colab file created by shahidul56 can be found [here](https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN/pull/22) and [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/shahidul56/ESRGAN/blob/master/ESRGAN.ipynb). This notebook is a modification by styler00dollar.


#### Important information

- If you can't open `Colab-ESRGAN (old-arch).ipynb` inside your Google Drive, try this [colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LK7XuMl3fpgTd44P4lIJ0X4RjbD_F7TL?usp=sharing) and save it to your Google Drive. The "open in Colab"-button can be missing in Google Drive, if that person never used Colab.
- This master is old-arch and is far more compatible than the original master.
- ESRGAN tutorials and custom models can be found in this [wiki page](https://upscale.wiki/wiki/Main_Page).
- Google Colab does assign a random GPU. It depends on luck.
- The Google Colab VM does have a maximum session length of 12 hours. Additionally there is a 30 minute timeout if you leave colab. The VM will be deleted after these timeouts.
